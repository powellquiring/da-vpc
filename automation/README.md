# Contents of the automation directory

## The following two methods are supported to automate the lifecycle management of this deployable architecture:

1. `github-actions` directory: This directory contains starter scripts to onboard your customized bundle into `IBM Cloud` via `Catalog management` by using `GitHub Actions`. For more information about GitHub actions, see [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
2. `toolchain` directory: This directory contains starter scripts to create a `Toolchain` on `IBM Cloud` that contains a starter script that will create a starter toolchain along with a `Gitlab` repository that contains the files from the customized bundle. For more information about toolchains, see [Develop secure infrastructure as code with DevSecOps practices](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fus-east.git.cloud.ibm.com%2Fopen-toolchain%2Fiac-compliance-ci-toolchain&env_id=ibm:yp:us-east) on IBM Cloud.
